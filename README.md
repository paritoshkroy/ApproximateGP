The repository includes the source files used to prepare the **webpage** (https://paritoshkroy.github.io/ApproximateGP/), which outline the Gaussian process approximation methods implemented in Stan. 

Artificial datasets are analysed to illustrate the methods.

The purpose of this documentation is to facilitate my personal development and to share my insights with others who share similar interests. I hope it becomes a valuable resource for anyone who finds these topics as engaging as I do. 

**This documentation is still a work in progress. I am continually learning and will update it over time.**
